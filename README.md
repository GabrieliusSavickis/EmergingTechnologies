The project focuses on Deutsch's algorithm, a fundamental quantum computing concept. The Jupyter notebook provides an in-depth exploration of the algorithm, including problem formulation, classical solutions, and quantum advantages.

#### Content Overview:
- Introduction
  - Background on Deutsch's Algorithm
  - Classical vs. Quantum Solutions
- Problem Statements
  - Details of Each Task
- Quantum Circuit Implementation
  - Code snippets using Qiskit
  - Simulation and Results
- Conclusion
  - Summary of Findings
