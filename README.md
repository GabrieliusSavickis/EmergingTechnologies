# Emerging Technologies

This is my repository for the module Emerging Technologies. Here you will find two jupyter notebooks which contain the tasks I completed during the semester and the final project.

## [Tasks](/tasks.ipynb)
1. The Collatz Conjecture Problem
2. Approximate the square root of a floating point number x without using the power operator or a package
3. Determine the number of possible functions taking four bits as input and outputting a single bit
4. Write a function that performs matrix multiplication on two rectangular lists containing floats in python
