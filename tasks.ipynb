    "\n",
    "The Collatz Conjectuce Problem[[1]](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-still-cant-solve-the-collatz-conjecture-20200922/) is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It's a relatively simple, yet intriguing mathematical puzzle that has stumped mathematics for decades. The conjecture is named after the German mathetmatician Lothar Collatz, who first introduced it in 1937.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=The%20Collatz%20conjecture%20is%20one,every%20positive%20integer%20into%201.)"
